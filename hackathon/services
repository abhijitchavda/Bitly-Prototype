front end

increment the counter for id by one and pass the id and original url to write service

Write service takes id and converts it to hash small url and sends it back to UI in response. It  takes id , short url and original url and write it to mongodb instance.

in UI short URL is displayed

Now user takes this URL and ping it... it is the redirecting service.. it takes the appended short url.. converts it to find id.. uses that id to retrive original URL and incerement a count by 1 ... and in response it redirects the user to original URL.

in redirect server change the ip of mongo instance .... 

data schema
{
"_id":12345.
"shortURL":"/dnh",
"originalURL":"https://www.google.com/",
"count":8
}
